# Greeny
Greeny is a conversational agent that helps you to have green habits at your home.

## About this repository
This repository contains the source code of its backend, responsible to handle DialogFlow fulfillments.
Furthermore, it contains a submodule for the optimization engine hosted to a different repository.

## Current project status
At the moment Greeny has the base to grow up and learn new skills, no integrations with particular platforms is implemented however. This allows to integrate Greeny with the desired platform through DialogFlow integrations at any time if needed.

## Disclaimer
Greeny only works on Linux at the moment and it is heavily dependent from system packages in order to run the optimization engine Python script.
